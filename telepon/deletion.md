## Account Deletion Policy

1. **User-Initiated Deletion**  
   - **Request Process**: If you wish to delete your TELEPON account, please contact our support team at **support@telepon.app** and provide the email address associated with your account.  
   - **Verification**: To ensure the security of your data, we may require additional information or verification (e.g., confirmation via reply email) to confirm your identity.

2. **Deletion Timeframe**  
   - **Processing**: We strive to process all deletion requests within a reasonable timeframe, typically within **30 days** of receiving a verified request.  
   - **Completion Notification**: Once your account is deleted, you will receive a confirmation email from us indicating that the process has been completed.

3. **Data Removal**  
   - **Active Databases**: Upon account deletion, we will remove your personal data (including profile information and user-generated content that is specifically tied to your account) from our active databases.  
   - **Backups**: Copies of your data may remain in our backup systems for a limited time (up to **90 days**, unless otherwise specified) but will be purged according to our routine backup rotation schedule.

4. **Ward Accounts & Group Data**  
   - **Wards**: If you are a Guardian or Admin managing a Ward account, deleting your account may also deactivate or delete associated Ward accounts. Please clarify if you wish only to delete your personal caregiver account or any linked Ward accounts.  
   - **Group Messages**: Messages that you posted in group chats may remain visible to other group members if they are not uniquely tied to your personal account. The Admin or group members (where applicable) may still see past messages that have not been removed from the group conversation.

5. **Limitations & Exceptions**  
   - **Legal Obligations**: We may retain certain information if necessary to comply with legal obligations (e.g., tax, accounting, or law enforcement requirements).  
   - **Service Improvements or Security**: We may keep anonymized or aggregated data (which cannot personally identify you) for analysis, product improvement, or security purposes.

6. **Effect of Deletion**  
   - **Service Access**: After your account is deleted, you will lose access to TELEPONâ€™s features, including any groups or messages associated with your account.  
   - **Reinstatement**: Account deletion is generally permanent. If you wish to use TELEPON again, you will need to create a new account.

7. **Contact Us**  
   - If you have questions, concerns, or require assistance with account deletion, please email us at **support@telepon.app**.
